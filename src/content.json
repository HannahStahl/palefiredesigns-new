    "I have been designing and handcrafting art jewelry for the past 15 years, specializing in one-of-a-kind designs that feature collectible lampwork beads, pearls, gemstones and precious metals.",
    "I blame my older sister, rock hound that she is, for igniting my passion for gemstones. When we were little kids growing up in New Hampshire, she somehow wrangled me into helping her crack garnets and mica out the granite stones she dug up in our back yard. And I was instantly transfixed! My mother was at least partially responsible for sparking my interest in those amazing miniature works of art called lampwork glass. And my dad got me hooked on pearls with that stunning strand he bought on a business trip to Japan and gave to me on my 12th birthday.",
    "I see great beauty in the irregularities and randomness of the natural world and try to emulate that beauty in my jewelry creations. I also believe in the Chinese concept of yin yang--that opposites attract and complement one another to give rise to a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. That's why I'm always looking to combine contrasting elements that offset and enhance each other.",
    "My work is for sale in gallery stores in the Washington, D.C. area, and my designs have been published in various books and magazines."
